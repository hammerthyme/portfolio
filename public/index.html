                <h2>Hey, I'm Samer</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a software engineer currently based in NYC. My specialties are fullstack JavaScript, with a slight preference for back-end development. I consider myself a curious individual who's always looking for fun new things to learn. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started my career in consulting and project management. In October 2016, after a few years of work,  I decided to shake things up and quit my job to pursue some personal goals over a year+ sabbatical.
                    During that time I spent 3 months teaching Math and English at a refugee camp in Greece, 1 month wwoofing on two farms in rural Hungary, 1 month cycling from Geneva, Switzerland to Budapest, Hungary, 
                    and 7 months backpacking across Southern Africa. It was all an amazing experience, to say the least. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout my trip, I was shocked by just how ubiquitous technology's positive reach has become. Mobile banking,
                    farmers researching various crops, children learning English online, the list goes on. After my trip, I decided I wanted to contribute to the progress of tech and enrolled in 
                    a fullstack engineering bootcamp.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've learned a ton so far, although I know the journey has really just begun. Feel free to take a look at some projects I've worked on below.
